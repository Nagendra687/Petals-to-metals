To run the code on Kaggle, follow these steps:

1. **Open Kaggle:** Visit [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and log in or sign up.

2. **Open the Kaggle Kernel:** Click on the "Kernels" tab and then click on the "Notebooks" sub-tab.

3. **Create a New Notebook:**
   - Click on "New Notebook."
   - Select "Python" as the language.

4. **Copy and Paste the Code:**
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook cell.
   - Copy the code from the provided notebook or script in this repository.

5.  **select accelator as tpu**
   -This allow us to utilize the tpu
6.  **Run the Notebook:**
   - Run the cells one by one or use the "Run All" option to execute the entire notebook.

7. **Adjust Parameters:**
   - If needed, modify parameters such as learning rates, batch sizes, etc., based on your experimentation.
   - modifying parameters will change your results
